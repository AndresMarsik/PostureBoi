# PostureBoi
Posture Correction Device designed and developed for Bioinstrumentations course

Written and developed by Andres Marsik using free open source libraries

Compact, non-intrusive device designed to alert the user whenever their posture is not adequate. Uses a 6 DoF IMU to measure inertia and alert the user whenever the inertia tips over a threshold.

To operate:

Turn on, wait for the signal showing that the calibration is done
Once the device is inclined enough, haptic feedback will trigger.
Improvements:

Install a potentiometer to adjust the dead-zone of the device manually.
Design compact casing with magnets to attach to shirt collar
